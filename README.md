## Installation

To install Sunset to Sunset, follow these steps:

1. Do **one** of the following:
	* Download & unzip the file and place the `sunsettosunset` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
	* **OR** do a `git clone https://github.com/cavellblood/sunsettosunset.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder. 
You can then update it with `git pull`
	* **OR** install with Composer via `composer require /sunsettosunset`
2. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings &rarr; Plugins
3. The plugin folder should be named `sunsettosunset` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

Sunset to Sunset works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.

## Sunset to Sunset Overview

It also adds a time guard to the edges of the Sabbath allowing the site to close a set amount of time before and open a set amount of time after the Sabbath hours.
